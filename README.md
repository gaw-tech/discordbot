# discordbot
My crappy discordbot.

For the bot to work there must be a file called "config.txt" in the same directory as the main funcion.
In this file there must be the following lines:
 slash_channels:{"<ids of allowed channels>", "<...>", ..., "<...>"}
 myId:"<id of bot owner>"
 javaRoot:"<path where the loaded modules should be compiled to>"
 nasaapikey:"<nasa api key>"
 modules:{}
 token:"<bot token>"
